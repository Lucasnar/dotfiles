# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles created based on this [Hacker News' thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) and [this article](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).

When I use this repository to actually get my dotfiles up and running on another user, I will add the instructions on how to get them up and running.
